Install
=======

If you have a Linux system, you can use the binary distribution.
Uncompress the file and put the binaries somewhere in your PATH.

Another alternative is to install the source distribution.

seq_crumbs depends on python 2.7 or newer and Biopython_ 1.60 or newer.

An easy way to install Biopython would be to use the packaging system of your Linux distribution or alternatively just run the following command::

  $ easy_install biopython

or

  $ pip install biopython

If you don't have easy_install installed
you can grab it from the setuptools_ site.

Once you have installed the dependencies you can install seq_crumbs::

  $ tar -xvzf seq_crumbs-0.1.tar.gz
  $ cd seq_crumbs-0.1
  $ python setup.py install
